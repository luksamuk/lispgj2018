# lispgj2018
My entry on Lisp Game Jam 2018.

This game is written in Common Lisp, built using SBCL, Emacs+SLIME, and Quicklisp.

This entry makes extensive use of my `game-sketch` system, which I built to help me create this game.
You'll find it, along with install instructions, [in this repository](https://github.com/luksamuk/game-sketch).
